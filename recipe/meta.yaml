  summary: An interface to the NetCDF file format designed by Unidata for efficient storage of array-oriented scientific data and descriptions. The R interface is closely based on the C API of the NetCDF library, and it includes calendar conversions from the Unidata UDUNITS library. The current implementation supports all
    operations on NetCDF datasets in classic and 64-bit offset file formats, and NetCDF4-classic format is supported for reading and modification of existing files.
